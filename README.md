## Welcome to Nick Hamilton's life story 

I am 23 years old and a graduate for Dimension Data in the GAP program. I have a deep love for sports and people, as well as having a curiosity with regrads to technology and its capabilities especially in a country like South Africa. 

### Education 
 I went to high school in Pretoria at St Albans College and then moved to Cape Town where I achieved my honours in entrepreneurship and management in 2019.
