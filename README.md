## Welcome to Nick Hamilton's life story 

I am 23 years old and a graduate for Dimension Data in the GAP program. I have a deep love for sports and people, as well as having a curiosity with regrads to technology and its capabilities especially in a country like South Africa. I enjoy socialzing with friends and have a taste for ale. Family is very important to me and I am lucky to have many family members in and around my home. 

### Education 
 I went to high school in Pretoria at St Albans College and then moved to Cape Town where I achieved my honours in entrepreneurship and management in 2019. 


### Projects

I have worked on projects within the Digital Advisory arm of the business, as well as the CX, Sales and now Intelligent Workplace areas which has given me a broad understanding of the different facets of the business. 

### Skills

I am a confident yet humble character I like to think, listening is a key area of strength as well as enjoying collaborative work in teams. Creative problem solving is an area I have used in the past within teams to help achieve goals and am always willing to learn and accept that I will always be a student absorbing knowledge where I can.
